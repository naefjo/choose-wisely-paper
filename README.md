# Choose Wisely: Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems Using Online Data Selection

Supplementary code to the paper.

The notebooks implement select-DeePC for various gym environments and produce the plots found in the paper.

The source code can be found in `select_deepc`. There, you'll find an implementation of `DeePC`, time windowed `DeePC` as well as `select-DeePC` with accompanying selection mechanisms and simulation utils.
